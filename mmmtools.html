                Made to provide a visual interface for creating dialogue scenes effectively, with a focus on enabling
                quick previews of the scene. The core components of the tool were planned and developed in four days,
                with gradual expansion over time.
            </p>
            <p>
                A similar tool available for Godot is Dialogic, which I looked at when designing my own system. The
                reason I did not just use Dialogic itself comes down to a few reasons: 1) I needed to control the way
                the scenes are displayed, and 2) I wanted more preview ability in the editor itself. These things would
                have required large changes to their code, so I decided to create a specialized tool instead.

                    Each event has an editor interface that can be instantiated into the tool UI. Each event could be
                    drastically different with various requirements, so a generic interface is not feasible and a
                    specific design for each is needed. The editor is passed a reference to the event object it
                    inspects, and is responsible for applying changes.

                    Adding new events to the editor doesn’t take a lot of effort. The first step is to create the UI
                    inspector for the event. A lot of the time, just duplicating and modifying an existing inspector
                    gets you started even quicker. The interface script only needs to implement the <code>inspectEvent(event)</code>
                    method, and an <code>updateFields()</code> method which applies the state to the UI. Individual controls may
                    require their own implementation, but they all notify the main UI of changes via signal.
                    Once the UI is made, only a single script needs to be updated with information about the new event
                    and editor so that the event class and interface is associated with an id.

                <p>
                    An issue with using string keys for the string table is that with manual entry it is prone to typos.
                    To ease this I implemented a dropdown selector for every key in the string table, with a simple
                    search in addition.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dialogue keys for referencing the strings table follow a particular format. For example we may have
                    the key <code>D_INVESTIGATION3_VIC_DISCUSS_2</code>. The purpose of the format becomes more obvious
                    if we replace
                    the underscores with slashes like so: <code>D/INVESTIGATION3/VIC/DISCUSS/2</code>. It’s easy to see
                    this as a folder hierarchy.
                    Most importantly is the final value, a number. For this example folder we have 48 different keys, yikes!
                    Imagine having to click to add every single one of these into the sequence and also add the rest of
                    the scene data on top of it.

                <p>
                    The solution to this is the ability to batch add an entire folder of keys as speak events to the
                    current sequence. We couldn’t autofill every single component however since predicting all the
                    associated data is not possible without manual data entry. When selecting the batch add option 
                    the user is prompted to select a group from the string table dropdown. All events in that group 
                    will be added in their numbered order.

                    Much of the data in dialogue sequences are ids for characters, resources, etc. Therefore it becomes
                    tedious to expect the user to memorize all possible values. As a result many editor fields implement
                    a dropdown selection with all the possible values. The way to obtain this list varies: many may need
                    to reference a file of a particular type, portrait expressions need to read the animation data, save
                    flags need to read the save file format, etc.

                <p class="text-center pt-0 mt-0">The play button that runs the currently opened dialogue sequence.</p>
                <p>
                    It also becomes important to get a rough preview of aspects of the scene without running it in game.
                    Several preview features are implemented for various events. For example: dialogue lines are shown in a textbox the 
                    same size as in game, portrait selection has a preview of the portrait on hovering on a pinnable icon, 
                    sound/music events have a play button. If any of this is not enough, you are also able to play the scene
                    (in isolation) through the editor to see exactly how it behaves.

                The hitbox editor was designed to solve the issue of difficult to visualize hitboxes when editing large
                amounts of hitbox data. For Star Apprentice, this means editing the hitbox data of each line of text in
                the bullet hell.
            </p>
            <p>
                You might consider that you could compute the position and bounds of a substring via the text system,
                but this is not in fact available with Godot’s RichTextLabel. So we have only the option of manually
                setting the hitbox data.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most importantly is the visual editor. The hitbox is drawn overtop the text line. When you hover your
                mouse over the hitbox you can click and drag to edit the position of the whole rectangle and each of the
                corners and edges. The selection is highlighted clearly so the user knows exactly what they’re editing.
