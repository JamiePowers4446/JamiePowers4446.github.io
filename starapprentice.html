                Originally made in a team of 6 over about 4 months, I later spent about 5 months recreating the game in
                a new engine. I designed many systems for the game and making systems that could be used again informed 
                my decisions on their design.

                <p>
                    The original version of the game was created using RPG Maker MV with the intention of pushing the
                    engine to its limits, and the difficulties I observed with this version informed decisions about
                    what engine to port the game to. Out of all the major engines right now, I needed something that
                    excelled at 2d and had custom editor support. As a result Godot Engine was a clear choice. I believe
                    in choosing the right tool for the job and this change will support development of other
                    games long term.

            <h3 class="my-3" id="dialoguesystem">Dialogue System</h3>
            <div class="text-start">
                <p>
                    I created a visual novel style dialogue system, which includes character portraits with multiple
                    expressions and support for an expandable amount of other actions. The system is split into the data
                    representation, the display components, and the <a href="mmmtools.html#dialogueeditor">editor</a>.
                </p>
                <h5>Data</h5>
                <p>
                    The dialogue is contained in the high level structure of a Dialogue Sequence, which contains a list
                    of all events that occur in order. In other words, it says <i>what</i> should happen in the scene.
                    Each
                    event is an object within this list, and it may also contain subsequences. Standard events include
                    directions for characters to speak, and also several events for sequence logic.
                </p>
                <pre><code>
    tool
    extends DialogEvent
    class_name SpeakEvent
    
    
    export (Resource) var character                     #The DialogCharacter resource of the speaker
    export (int) var displayName = 0                    #ID of the shown character nickname
    export (String, MULTILINE) var text:String = ""     #Line of text, used as key into string table
    export (bool) var showTalking = true                #Whether the character should be shown speaking the line
                </code></pre>
                <p class="text-center pt-0 mt-0">The resource script defining a line of dialogue.</p>
                <h5>Display</h5>
                <p>
                    The display system is set up to take a dialogue sequence as input and play it. It’s made of multiple
                    individual components under the main logic component that each handle their own type of task. There
                    are eight components in all including the Textbox, Portraits, and SignalCues
                    components.
                </p>

                    alt="The top level node structure of the dialogue scene.">
                <p>
                    The main logic component handles the sequencing. It starts each event in order, adding them to a set
                    of active events until it receives the ‘handled’ callback from all subcomponents. This allows
                    multiple events to process at once, say for example two characters appearing on screen
                    simultaneously.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The SignalCues component is of particular interest as this component can cover for any actions that
                    existing events do not support, such as one-off occurrences. This takes advantage of the signal
                    system in Godot, using a signal bus through the dialogue system interface. The signal broadcasts an
                    event identifier and any node is allowed to do something in response. What makes this even more
                    useful is that this can be received by the Godot AnimationPlayer node as the name of an animation to
                    play. Since the animator can do many things including function calls, this alone makes the entire
                    system able to do just about anything in the game pretty easily.

                <p>
                    The player may forget or miss dialogue, so we have a history log the player may reference at any
                    time. Though stored in a simple data structure we need to save it to a small binary format to
                    minimize disk space usage. Originally I saved the file as a JSON string, which had the benefit of
                    being easy, but was creating larger than ideal files with low amounts of data. My solution was to
                    create a binary data format to store the history data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I based the format on bits of information I knew about image formats. The file format has a byte stream
                    structure. The first byte is an id number for the type of event. 256 values is unlikely to ever be
                    exceeded, but it could be expanded by using an extra byte if the value is set to certain special values.
                    The next bits will depend on the type of event. A speak event for example has two bytes for the
                    character id and nickname id, then the string id defining the line of text is saved as a null
                    terminated string. The next event can then be encoded immediately after in the byte sequence.
                </p>
                <pre><code>
    #Takes a dictionary containing the event data and encodes relevant data into a byte sequence.
    func serializeSpeakEvent(data:Dictionary)->PoolByteArray:
        #Format "EVENTID:CHARID:NAMEID:TEXT"
        var pool = PoolByteArray()

        pool.append(ID_SPEAK)          #Encode the ID for a SpeakEvent
        pool.append(data["charnum"])   #Encode Character ID
        pool.append(data["dname"])     #Encode character's Display Name(nickname)

        var text:PoolByteArray = Helpers.encodeStrAsBytes(data["text"])
        text.append(STRINGEND)
        pool.append_array(text)        #Encode text data

        return pool
                </code></pre>
                <p>
                    A helpful observation that can be made here is that there is a lot of repetition in this data. Each
                    scene will have the same set of characters with the same set of nicknames, and the dialogue line
                    keys are formatted in ways like <code>D_CHAPTERX_SCENEY_1</code>, where everything except the number
                    at the end
                    stays constant. This makes it a good candidate for standard compression algorithms and is something
                    I plan to explore further in the future. In my tests, the binary representation alone changed files
                    that were ~60kb into &lt;1kb. With compression I had &lt;100bytes on the same file. The game did not
                    ship with compression enabled however since there were issues with the decompression that gave
                    incorrect results, which is part of what I plan to explore.

                <p>
                    The bullet hell system needs to be able to handle a large amount of objects. I use a dynamic object
                    pooling system to ensure that spawning bullets is as efficient as possible. First each emitter will
                    pre-populate with a user-defined number of bullets and cache them all. The bullets are stored in an
                    array set up as a circular queue. When the emitter is to shoot a bullet, it pops one from the queue,
                    and when a bullet is destroyed it is pushed back. If there are no available bullets when spawning
                    then the array is expanded by another user-defined number of bullets. This all is to reduce the processing time
                    spent moving bullets around in memory.
                </p>
                <img src="mmm_screenshot18.png" class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block mb-3 screenshot"

                <p class="text-center pt-0 mt-0">One of the most dense patterns in the game. Note that the debug FPS counter reads 414.</p>
                <p>
                    The bullets themselves have more optimizations, and this is what saves the most processing time. The
                    bullets do not use the base collision nodes; instead they use the PhysicsServer to check collision.
                    I found that destroying bullets created the largest performance hit and so bullets simply turn off
                    all processing when they are destroyed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each piece of bullet hell content is designed to be modular while also easy to edit. The high level
                    content is called a Wave, which contains a single pattern and needs to be able to contain many
                    configurations of emitters, enemies, etc and any possible kind of behaviour for creating patterns.
                    To do this each is defined in a scene file (.tscn) with its own script. The bullet hell system only
                    needs to instantiate this scene and call its start method to use it. Since a saved scene can be
                    referenced as a PackedScene, it is easy to reference from a Resource object.

                    Interactable objects, including NPCs, props, and doors, need to select dialogue based on your
                    current progress in the game. In order to make it easy to have complex rules, each of these objects
                    uses a behaviour tree to select which dialogue sequence to use. The leaves of this tree contain the
                    dialogue sequence resources to play.

                <p>
                    The most important tree nodes are the Selector and the Sequencer. The Selector will attempt to run
                    each child node in order until one succeeds or all nodes are attempted. The Sequencer will run each
                    node in order until one of them fails. In terms of dialogue, the Selector lets us pick one sequence
                    out of a set to run and the Sequencer can be used to cycle through a set of dialogues in order.
                    These work together with the SaveFlag node and other decorator nodes to be able to play the correct
                    dialogue for the current point in the game.
