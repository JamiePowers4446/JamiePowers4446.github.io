            <p class="lead text-info my-3">Blast away deductions and solve the magical mystery in this danmaku-detective
                game!</p>
            <p>A game made for CMPUT 250 in the Fall 2020 term over about 4 months. I created all the art and planned
                the overall design of the game. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="p-3 mb-5 shadow-lg">
            <h3 class="my-3">Developing Assets Quickly</h3>
            <div class="text-start">
                <p>I was the only artist on Star Apprentice, so in order to complete the necessary assets it was
                    important to simplify and minimize the workload. My strategies for doing so revolve around
                    prioritizing assets by importance.</p>
                <div class="col mx-auto mb-3 d-block text-center">
                    <img src="minnieWalkStrip.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Minnie's walk spritesheet">
                    <img src="minnieWalk.gif" alt="Minnie walk animation">
                </div>
                <p>I applied Limited Animation techniques to the graphics of the game as a major way to get things done
                    quickly. The strategy is to animate only what is necessary, and use as few frames as possible doing
                    so. Minnie’s walk cycle is a great example of this as it uses only 6 frames. Though the game runs at
                    60 FPS each of these frames is held for 8 frames (meaning the animation is played at 7.5 FPS). If we
                    were to animate this at the full 60 FPS we would need 48 frames, which is clearly not feasible.</p>
                <div class="mx-auto mb-3">
                    <img src="bhbackground.gif" class="rounded mx-auto d-block"
                        alt="The background for Confrontation scenes.">
                </div>
                <p>Though smaller sprites were quick to make, there were a few large sprites which needed strategy to
                    complete quickly. One such example is the background in the “Confrontation” segments. Though the
                    game is made with pixel art, this is one component that was not made as pixel art. Instead it was
                    made by placing some planes in a Unity scene and taking screenshots while controlling the scrolling of the planes.
                    The color palette was then restricted afterward to help it fit with the other assets.</p>
                <div class="col text-center mb-3">
                    <div class=" mx-auto d-block">
                        <img src="basicPortrait_HoldingFlatObj.png" class="rounded" alt="A 3d model for pose reference">
                        <img src="irisPortrait.png" class="rounded" alt="Iris's portrait">
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>The character portraits were also an area where I decided to spend more time on because it was
                    important to communicating each character in more detail. The small sprite is created first to
                    establish the important aspects of the design. To start the portrait, I posed a 3d model which would
                    be used as reference. I then drew the details on top of this reference.</p>
