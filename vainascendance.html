                The goal for this project was to make the development as time efficient as possible. After the initial 4
                month development, I updated the game for release on Steam. This update was meant to learn how to
                integrate the
                Steam API and launch on Steam. I also took the opportunity to learn how to localize a game.

                <p>
                    I implemented the Steam API using a Godot plugin which provided the interface. We used the API
                    mainly for achievements, with a wrapper implemented in a singleton so that it is available across
                    the game easily.

                <p>
                    Since we ended up translating the game after the initial release, a lot of the game was not built to
                    accommodate it. However luckily Godot provides convenient features for localization. All of the text
                    is loaded from a csv file, then you simply call <code>tr(text)</code> to get the text from the
                    string table in
                    the current locale. Some graphics also needed alternate versions where they contained text, and
                    Godot has the “remaps” feature to swap them in for us.

                <p>
                    I selected the language specifically so that I’d have to update our pixel font with a small number
                    of new characters. The font characters are loaded from a spritesheet in a user defined order which
                    doesn’t have to follow ASCII or Unicode ordering. I manually check the font for any kerning
                    overrides, and the font resource is created.

                <p>
                    In order to accommodate complex player movement, I implemented the player character behaviour using
                    a modified state machine that stores active states in a stack. Each state controls the movement and
                    animation logic.

                <p class="text-center pt-0 mt-0">Valerie preparing a dash. This state has unique behaviours.</p>
                <p>
                    Each state may have entirely different logic. For example, when preparing a dash Valerie will slowly
                    float down. Then when dashing we want no gravity at all! The drinking state stops all input for a
                    moment. This could easily get unwieldy if many different pieces of the logic are wrapped in a bunch
                    of if statements to determine what we can and can’t do.

                    particles that spawn from the enemy and move toward Valerie.</p>

                <p>Most often I see people approach this via a physics simulation, but there are several reasons why we
                    can
                    do better! The largest issue I intended to solve was the possibility for the object to orbit its
                    target
                    in a gravity based system. There are many games that have this problem, one for example is you can
                    see
                    this in Hollow Knight if you equip the Gathering Swarm charm and move in just the right way.</p>
                <p>So maybe you’re wondering how I’m doing it, but to answer that we need to talk about <s>parallel
                        universes</s> Bezier curves. If you’d like to learn about Bezier curves in general I highly
                    recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVwxzDHniEw">Freya Holmer’s video</a> on them.
                    For our purposes we need them to define a curve in 2d space
                    which we travel along as a value denoted as t goes from 0 to 1 over a duration. </p>
                <p>For this purpose we use a <em>cubic</em> Bezier curve, which uses 4 points total including the
                    endpoints.
                    A quadratic curve, using 3 points, has some issues that we can address with the cubic curve. We can
                    number our points 1 through 4, with 1 being the start and 4 being the end of the curve, then 2 and 3
                    are
                    considered “control points” that shape the curve.</p>
                <img src="vainbezier2.png" class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block mb-3"
                    alt="A diagram of how the points of the curve are selected.">
                <p>The diagram above shows how we make the arc. Points 1 and 4 are of course the starting position
                    (where
                    the drop spawned) and ending position (the current position of Valerie, which may move). We need to
                    decide values for points 2 and 3 to make the path the most interesting. We can use the 2nd point to
                    create the arc, I selected random polar coordinates (a radius and angle) around the spawn point so
                    that
                    I could control the radius the particles fly out of the enemy. This could be selected in plenty of
                    other
                    ways depending on what kind of look you want. Earlier I mentioned that we needed a 4th point for
                    smoothing, and that is what we use point 3 for. If we used the quadratic curve the arc would move
                    awkwardly when Valerie moves. To solve this we initialize point 3 at Valerie’s position at the
                    initialization time then move the point towards her over time. Moving this at a constant rate is
                    sufficient to make the smoothing. In the end the final arc will look something like the blue curve
                    in
                    the diagram.</p>
                <p>To complete the effect we also want to control the rate at which the particle follows the path. Our
                    goal
                    is to have the particles hang for a moment after spawning before moving to Valerie. Earlier I
                    mentioned
                    how the path uses a t value to determine the point along the path: if we control the change in t
                    then we
                    can move along the path at a controlled speed. For this we need an easing function, with the
                    requirement
                    that inputting 0 returns 0 and inputting 1 returns 1, then what happens between can be anything we
                    want.
                    We could select from plenty of functions but a Bezier curve in 1d can also serve this purpose and
                    it’s
                    easy to tweak the exact shape. A curve that is close to {0,1,0,1} is what we want, and the shape of
                    that
                    curve is approximated in the image below. We then use the result of this curve as the t in our main
                    curve. The result is that the particles slow down for a moment before homing in towards Valerie.</p>
                <img src="vainbezier3.png" class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block mb-3"
                    alt="A diagram of a basic easing function used to control t.">
                <p>To animate this I simply store the main t value which each frame is incremented by
                    delta-time/duration.
                    Duration is how long in seconds the particle should take. It is useful for us to control this
                    duration
                    per particle. When the particle reaches the end of the path at t >= 1 we play a sound indicating
                    collecting it. By staggering the durations of a group of these particles we are guaranteed to play
                    the
                    sounds at a precise rhythm which feels quite satisfying!</p>

                    have time to animate a flowing ghost sheet by hand, so I used a shader to create the effect.

                <p>
                    The core of the effect is two scrolling noise textures are mixed to create the UV displacement,
                    which then is multiplied by a mask that says what parts of the sprite are allowed to be distorted
                    (we don’t want the head to distort). We also have a tilt with an intensity parameter, so that the
                    cloth appears to be trailing behind the ghost. A second copy of noise is used and the results
                    blended to create a wispy border.
